# University Search
HTML page that allows users to search for a university and retrieve results using JavaScript from a government database.

## Requires your own API Key
This program uses AJAX to query a government database and you will need your own key to access the database. Keys are obtained at https://api.data.gov/docs/.  

Once you obtain your key, insert it into the myKey variable on line 3.
